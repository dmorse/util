   * A MpiStructBuilder objects is used to create an MPI Struct datatype.
   *
   * This class provides methods to simplify construction of an MPI data 
   * type that can stores instances of a C struct or C++ class. 
   *
   * As an example, consider the creation of an MPI datatype MyClassMpi 
   * for class MyClass, with a class definition:
   * \code
   *
   * class MyClass 
   * {
   *    double x[3];
   *    int    i, j;
   * }
   *
   * \endcode
   * The code required to build and commit the MPI datatype MyClassMpi is:
   * \code
   *
   *    MyClass          object;
   *    MPI_Datatype  MyClassMpi;
   *    MpiStructBuilder builder;
   *
   *    builder.setBase(&object)
   *    builder.addMember(&object.x, MPI_DOUBLE, 3);
   *    builder.addMember(&object.i, MPI_INT, 1);
   *    builder.addMember(&object.j, MPI_INT, 1);
   *    builder.commit(&MyClassMpi);
   *
   * \endcode
   * The setBase and addMember classes require addresses of an instance 
   * of the class and of its members, respectively. These addresses must
   * all refer to same instance. The commit method calculates the offset
   * of each member by subtracting the address of the object from the
   * address of each of its members.
