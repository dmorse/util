The files in this directory implements a variant of the MPI 1.2 
C++ bindings. Development of this variant of the MPI C++ bindings
was motivated by the fact that the C++ bindings were officially
deprecated in MPI 2.2, and slated for removal in MPI 3. Because
these bindings are used throughout the Util and Simpatico 
packages, inclusion of this code is intended to provide a path
for these packages to become independent of any implementation
provided by an MPI library, since the availability of such an
implemetation is no longer guaranteed. 

All of the code in this directory that was derived from the 
implementation of the C++ bindings provided in the Open MPI
(ompi) package, starting from corresponding files in the 
ompi/ompi/mpi/cxx directory of an ompi source code repository 
that was cloned from the github server in March 2018. A list 
of copyright holders for the ompi source is given in the file 
named ompiCopyright in the same directory as this file. 

The ompi source code for the C++ bindings  was modified by:

- Changing the namespace name MPI (which is specified in 
  the MPI 1.2 standard) to the name Util::Mpi.

- Modifying the code format and names of some internal 
  variables so as to follow conventions used in Util.

- Removing functions and constants that were not simple
  wrappers around standard C MPI functions or constants,
  and that depended on other non-standard ompi functions.

The name of the enclosing namespace was changed to allow a 
user to select this local implementation by changing the 
MPI:: namespace qualifier to Mpi:: or Util::Mpi:: throughout 
any code that uses the C++ MPI binding.

For the moment (early 2018) the "MPI::" namespace name 
is still used throughout the Util and Simpatico source 
code outside of this subdirectory, thus relying on C++
bindings provided by an MPI library. The plan is to 
switch over to use of "Mpi::", perhaps defined by a 
preprocessor if and when this becomes necessary.
