The classes in the util/ directory tree provide general utilities 
for scientific programming in C++.  This directory is maintained 
as a separate repository on github in order to allow it to be used 
in more than one software projects.

Subdirectories:
---------------

misc           Exception, Log, FileMaster and other utilities
format         formatted output of primitive types in ostreams
memory         class for managing dynamically allocated memory
containers     container template classes and associated iterators
mpi            utilities for MPI programming
param          parameter file input and output
math           mathematical constants and operations
space          Cartesian vectors, tensors, and grids
archives       serialization (similar to Boost serialization)
random         random number generator
accumulators   statistical accumulator classes

Makefile targets:
-----------------

The makefile in src/util may be used to compile the classes in src/util.
The most important targets are:

make all       make all *.o files in src/util
make clean     remove all *.o files in src/util
