The classes in the util/ directory tree provide general utilities for 
scientific programming in C++. This directory was originally developed 
as part of the Simpatico molecular simulation package. It is maintained
as a separate git repository to allow it to be used in other packages, 
and is used as a submodule of the simpatico git repository. 

A brief description of the contents of the various subdirectories of 
util/ is given in the CONTENTS file.

Required Parent Directories
---------------------------

The util package may be installed either as part of larger git repository, 
as a submodule, or as a standalone package. A standalone installation of 
the util package is a convenient place to work on development and testing 
of the util package itself. In either case, the util/ directory that contains
the contents of the dmorse/util github repository must be a subdirectory of
a directory named "src/", which should itself be a subdirectory of the root
directory for the project. The required directory structure is thus

ROOT/
ROOT/src/
ROOT/src/util

where ROOT refers to the name of the root directory of the software project,
and ROOT/src/util is a directory that was originally created by cloning the
dmorse/util github repository, or by creating a submodule of an enclosing
repository. If the util/ directory was created as a standalone directory by
cloning the github repository, then can safely moved (using unix mv command)
after it is created without disturbing synchronization with the server. 

Standalone Installation 
-----------------------

Instructions to installation util in a directory tree that is not part of
a larger project:

1) Create the directory structure described above, in which the working copy
of the git repository is located in directory ROOT/src/util.

2) Change directory (cd) to the ROOT/src/util directory.

3) From the ROOT/src/util directory, enter the command

   > .config/setup

   This will create directories named ROOT/bin and ROOT/scripts and will
   place copies of several files in these new directories as well as in 
   the ROOT/src/ and ROOT/src/util directories.

4) Your PYTHONPATH must be set to allow python to find several module
   files that are installed in the ROOT/scripts/pytyon directory. If your 
   PYTHONPATH is already set up to allow you to compile simpatico in a 
   separate directory on the same computer, then the PYTHONPATH should 
   already include the corresponding simpatico/scripts/python directory 
   of your simpatico installation. This directory contains identical copies 
   of the required python modules. In this case, you do not need to further 
   modify your python path. If you have not already set your PYTHONPATH
   to allow compilation of simpatico on the same computer, then you will 
   need to modify your PYTHONPATH to include the ROOT/scripts/python 
   directory of the standalone installation of the util package. 

5) From the ROOT/src/util directory, invoke

   > make all

Makefile targets:
-----------------

The makefile in src/util may be used to compile the classes in src/util.
The most important targets are:

make all       make all *.o files in src/util
make clean     remove all *.o files in src/util
